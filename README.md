# Flocky
Simulation of flocking behavior


This application mimics the flocking behavior of birds using 3 primary parameters: Cohesion, Alignment, and Separation.

This objects start at random positions in the air and will slowly flock to each other. 

#### Future Features:
- Perfect flocking simulation
- Create "Add Plane" feature for more interactivity that will cause birds to move in order to avoid collision
